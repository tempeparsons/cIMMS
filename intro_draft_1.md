Introduction. 

Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Its incidence has increased rapidly in the last few decades and it continues to do so. Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is stored in the beta cell along with insulin secetory granules, and plays a role in regulating glucose metabolism. The accumulation of hIAPP aggregates has been shown to correlate with the severity of type 2 diabetes and studies suggest the amyloid fibrils are toxic to beta cells - but that the pre-fibril form where several soluble monomers have formed a soluble oligomer appears even more toxic. Understanding the soluble structure of hIAPP would provide insights into how these oligomers are formed and why they are cytotoxic. Although structures hav been derived for various fibrillar forms, hIAPP is an intrinsically disordered protein whose monomeric or oligomeric structure cannot be elucidated through crystallography.

One technique that has proved important in helping elucidate the structures of complete or partially disordered proteins is ion-mobility. In structural IM, a purified protein, complex or other molecule is delivered into the instruemnt such that non-covlent interactions within the macromolcule(s), and hence structural information, is retained. In essence, the technique measures the time taken for a molecule to move through a neutral gas. The more unfolded the macromolecule, the larger the area that can collide with gas molecules, so the longer it takes to arrive at the detector. This area is referred to as the collisionnal cross section (CCS). When combined with other sources of information, as descibed later, CCS informs on the different structures a protein or complex can assume. 

When ion-mobility is coupled to mass spectrometry IM can be performed on a selected mass/charge (m/z) window. This increased resolution of peaks within the arrival time distrbution data because, although structural IM is performed on a purified solution, a large array of conformers and charge states are present. The applicability of ion-mobility has been further increased by combining it with other structural evidence such as molecular dynamics or crystllography datasets. Here, the CCS calculated from arrival time data can show which theoretically derived strucutres are correct or reveal the true mobility range of a crystal strucuture. IM-MS can yield very precise structural information in comparison studies where the CCS obtained from comparative studies of e.g. proteins with point mutations or highly similar proteins from different species show directly the sequence responsible for certain unfolding responses. Structural integrity can be interrogated yet further by introducing an external disruption such as a voltage, or ramped sequence of volatages, and measuring the change in population of unfolding species. 

These advances have dramatically increased the resolution and aplicability of IM-MS, but are inherently limited in the sense that the unfolding products of the parent protein must be examined as a whole. It is not possible, for example, to selectively trap mutiple unfolding products and investigate their stability individually. This way the structural routes from parent to particular product could be traced, which is critical to understanding formation of amyloid fibrils. The advent of cyclic IM-MS has changed this. In this technique, the linear drift tube is replace with a cyclic IM device. Not only does the longer drift distance increase resolution, but the point of ion entry/exit can store ions of a selected mobility i.e. an ion 'slice' from the mobility circuit. Seelected, stored ions can be returned to the mobiltiy circuit and unfolding can be induced by a voltage before or after the circuit, providing great precision and flexibility in experimental design and data accumulation. 

In order for arrival time data to be converted into CCS's, the total arrival time spectrum must be deconvoluted into its component peaks, as each peak represents an unfolding structure. A large protein or protein complex subject to sveral voltage steps may contain many peaks, of which each mean and variance will represent a different degree of unfolding. In this study we compare structural stability of two slices of IAPPs from human and from rat by identifying the mean and variance of peaks in arrival time data. Arrival time data for each slices was obtained prior to this study by passing rat and human parent polypeptides around the cyclic drift track, selecting the two most prominent unfolding products from each, then subjecting these to a ramped voltage. Typically, peak identification would be carried out using one of the available softwares for IM-MS. However, data from cyclic IM-MS is more complex for these softwares to be of practical use, as one parent protein can generate multiple datasets depending on the number of mobility slices selected and voltage ramps performed. This study therefore aims to find a method for identifying peaks which is straightforward enough that it can be easily incorporated into a future piece of software written specifically for cyclic IM-MS. This study also presents some preliminary aspects of data visualisation for this hypothetical software.
